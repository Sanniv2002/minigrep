I'm silent, drifting, lost in thought,  
A whisper, barely felt or sought.  
Are you adrift, unclaimed as well?  
Two shadows in a hidden swell.  

How strange to be the ones unseen,  
No gilded page, no loud routine,  
Not tied to names that crowds applaud,  
Just us, unbound, at peace, and flawed.  

For who would choose the echo's cry,  
To shout a name 'neath open sky,  
To dance on stage where all can see,  
Forsaking quiet company?
